# plotly-interactive

Allows interactive plotting using plotly backend. Implements a plot showing allelic frequencies of mutations for many samples, with filtering for mutation type and GnomAD frequency. 

Currently, interactivity lives in a Jupyter Notebook but it can be extended to work with Plotly Dash.
